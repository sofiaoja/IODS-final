## Abstract

Summary of analysis.

Cell area and perimeter parameters were increasing as fuction of PD and culture time.

## Research question

Brief description of the "research question" you are exploring, possibly including your hypothesis.

In this study different cell morphology parameters were studied how they describe cell growth and differentiation, cell area and cell perimeter were analysed and goal was also to find parameter describing cell branchiness.

Hypothesis are

- Cell area increases with cell age / time
- Cell perimeter increases with cell age / time
- Cell branchiness increases with cell age / time

## Description of data and its variables

Description of your data and its variables. Where is the data from, what does it relate to, what do the variables represent, what has been done to the data before analysis?

Cells were studied at different passages P1, P3, P5 and P7.

Cells were measured at BIU imaging lab and analysed with machine vision analysis software and various cell morphology parameters were obtained.

Cell morphology parameters

- ObjectAreaCh1	(units pixels) = area of the cell, area (in pixels or micrometers^2) of Ch1 object
- ObjectPerimCh1 (units pixels) = perimeter of the cell, perimeter (in pixels or micrometers) of Ch1 object 
- ObjectShapeP2ACh1	(units number) = Shape measure based on ratio of perimeter squared to 4pii*area of Ch1 object (ObjectShapeP2ACh1 = 1 for circular object) 
- ObjectShapeLWRCh1	(units number) = Shape measure based on ratio of length to width of object-aligned bounding box of Ch1 object 
- ObjectShapeBFRCh1	(units number) = Shape measure based on ratio of object area to box area of object-aligned bounding box of Ch1 object 
- ObjectLengthCh1 (units pixels) = Length (in pixels or micrometers) of object-aligned bounding box of Ch1 object 
- ObjectWidthCh1 (units pixels) = Width (in pixels or micrometers) of object-aligned bounding box of Ch1 object 
- ObjectConvexHullAreaRatioCh1 (units number) = Ratio of convex hull area to area of Ch1 object
- ObjectConvexHullPerimRatioCh1 (units number) = Ratio of convex hull perimeter to perimeter of 
Ch1 object 

## Analysis part

Visually clear and interesting explorations of the variables of interest in the data, from the point of view of your research question. Include interpretations of the distributions and relationships of the variables. Use captions to draw the reader's focus on the interesting parts of your tables and graphics.
Brief description of the method you are using in your own words.
Presentation of the results of your analysis including visualizations and summaries and a thorough interpretation of the results including a validation analysis of the method.
Conclusions and discussion.

Data was analysed using normal distribution, correlation, linear regression and dimensionality reduction techniques.

Strong correlations were found for cell area and perimeter parameters.

Linear regression model was explaining cell area as function of cell perimeter, width and length parameters.

Cell area and perimeter parameters were increasing as fuction of PD and culture time.
